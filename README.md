# Star Digital: Assessing the Effectivness of Display Advertising
This data analysis is originated from Harvard Business Publishing Case: Star Digital: Assessing the Effectivness of Display Advertising by Sridhar Narayanan, Taylan Yildiz. Star Digital, a video service provider with over $100 million in annual ad spend, faced challenges in measuring online display ad effectiveness. They used ROI data for spending decisions but found standard methods either underestimated or overestimated conversion rates. To accurately assess the impact on sales conversion, Star Digital conducted a controlled experiment for one of its campaigns. The case study focuses on the experiment's design and addresses ad campaign design issues.
